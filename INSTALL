Installing on Linux and other POSIX systems
===========================================

Prerequisites:

        - The Qt library, version 4.x.x
        - A C++ compiler

Compilation:

        Unpack the source .tar.gz, or do "git clone git://github.com/bullestock/c45b.git"
        
        cd c45b
        qmake-qt4
        make

Installation:

On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), I recommend
installing using

           sudo checkinstall --fstrans=no --pkgname=c45b --pkggroup=Electronics

This approach should also work on RPM-based systems (RedHat and derivatives), 
as well as Slackware, but I have not tried this.

Otherwise, simply do

           sudo install



Installing on Windows
=====================

Prerequisites:

        - Install the Qt SDK from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-windows-cpp

Compilation:

        - Unpack the source ZIP file, or do "git clone git://github.com/bullestock/c45b.git"
        - Start Qt Creator
        - Click 'Open project...'
        - Browse to the c45b.pro file and click OK
        - Press Ctrl-T and select 'Qt 4.7.3 for Desktop - MinGW 4.4 (Qt SDK) Release'
        - In the Build menu, select 'Build All'
        - After a while, a single error and some warnings will be shown. 
          These can be safely ignored.
        - Finally, copy the following files:

          ...\c45b-build-desktop\console\release\c45b.exe
          ...\c45b-build-desktop\qserialport\lib\QSerialPort1.dll
          c:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.7.3\mingw\lib\QtCore4.dll
          c:\QtSDK\mingw\bin\libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll

          to the folder where you want to install c45b. Add that folder to your PATH.
