c45b is a frontend to the AVR bootloader from Chip45 GmBH
(see http://www.chip45.com/info/chip45boot2.html for details).

Currently, only a command-line version is provided.

To build, you will need g++ and Qt4.

Installation:

        git clone git://github.com/bullestock/c45b.git
        cd c45b
        qmake
        make

On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu), I recommend
installing using

           sudo checkinstall

Otherwise, simply do

           sudo install

For help, run c45b --help.
